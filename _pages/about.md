## About Me

I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Resource Economics** at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, graduating in 2025.  
My research lies at the intersection of **industrial organization, applied microeconomics, and sustainable finance**, with a focus on how market structure and public policy shape firm behavior.

On the academic job market (2025–26), I combine rigorous economic modeling with applied data analysis, while also bringing substantial teaching experience as both a sole instructor and teaching assistant across a range of economics and finance courses.

## Research

### Job Market Paper  
**“Quality and Spatial Competition: Evidence from U.S. Restaurants”**  
- Extends the Hotelling spatial competition framework by introducing **consumer heterogeneity** and **restaurant quality differentiation**.  
- Develops a model with four restaurants, accounting for both horizontal and vertical differentiation.  
- Empirically, I analyze the U.S. restaurant industry using data from **Yelp, TripAdvisor, and population density measures**, showing that higher-quality restaurants cluster more in competitive markets, while lower-quality restaurants occupy less dense areas.  
- Results provide new insights into how consumer preferences and quality affect spatial distribution in imperfectly competitive industries.

### Additional Research  
- **Green Technology Innovation and U.S. Policy**: Studying the effects of the Inflation Reduction Act and related climate policies on firm-level green technology adoption, carbon emissions, and innovation.  
- **Sustainable Finance**: Exploring how subsidies and public investment in renewable energy influence corporate R&D and long-run environmental outcomes.  
- **Applied Microeconomics**: Broader interest in empirical industrial organization and how policy interventions reshape competitive dynamics.

## Teaching

As sole instructor, I have taught:  
- **Res-Econ 323: Financial Analysis for Consumers and Firms** (Fall 2024, Spring 2025)  
- **Res-Econ 213: Intermediate Statistics for Business and Economics** (Summer 2023)  

My teaching evaluations demonstrate strong student engagement and effectiveness — for example, in Spring 2025, 91% of students rated my teaching as *“almost always”* or *“usually effective”* (Q10 mean = 4.5/5.0, above department and campus averages).  

I have also served as teaching assistant for **Introductory Econometrics, Industrial Organization, Managerial Economics, Public Policy in Private Markets, Price Theory,** and **Statistics for Social Sciences**, earning the **Vijay Bhagavan Teaching Assistant of Distinction Award (2022)**.
