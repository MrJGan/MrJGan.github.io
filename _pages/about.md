I am a Ph.D. student in Resource Economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

My research mainly lies at the intersection of **industrial organization and applied microeconomics**, with a focus on how market structure and public policy shape firm behavior.

On the academic job market (2025‚Äì26), I combine rigorous economic modeling with applied data analysis, while also bringing substantial teaching experience as both a sole instructor and teaching assistant across a range of economics and finance courses.

In addition to economics, I hold a **Master of Science in Computer Science (Georgia Institute of Technology, 2024)**, which strengthens my expertise in **data science, machine learning, and computational methods**. This interdisciplinary training allows me to integrate advanced quantitative techniques into empirical research in industrial organization and sustainable finance.

## Research

### Job Market Paper  
**‚ÄúQuality and Spatial Competition: Evidence from U.S. Restaurants‚Äù**  
- Extends the Hotelling spatial competition framework by introducing **consumer heterogeneity** and **restaurant quality differentiation**.  
- Develops a model with four restaurants, accounting for both horizontal and vertical differentiation.  
- Empirically, I analyze the U.S. restaurant industry using data from **Yelp, TripAdvisor, and population density measures**, showing that higher-quality restaurants cluster more in competitive markets, while lower-quality restaurants occupy less dense areas.  
- Results provide new insights into how consumer preferences and quality affect spatial distribution in imperfectly competitive industries.

## Teaching

As sole instructor, I have taught:  
- **Res-Econ 323: Financial Analysis for Consumers and Firms** (Fall 2024, Spring 2025)  
- **Res-Econ 213: Intermediate Statistics for Business and Economics** (Summer 2023)  

My teaching evaluations demonstrate strong student engagement and effectiveness: for example, in Spring 2025, 91% of students rated my teaching as *‚Äúalmost always‚Äù* or *‚Äúusually effective‚Äù* (Q10 mean = 4.5/5.0, above department and campus averages).  

I have also served as a teaching assistant for **Introductory Econometrics, Industrial Organization, Managerial Economics, Public Policy in Private Markets, Price Theory,** and **Statistics for Social Sciences**.

In recognition of my contributions, I received the **Vijay Bhagavan Teaching Assistant of Distinction Award (2022), awarded by the Department of Resource Economics**.
